I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at Fudan University, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://henghuiding.github.io/">Henghui Ding</a>. And I am also a member of the <a href="https://fvl.fudan.edu.cn">Fudan Vision and Learning Laboratory</a>. Before that, I was a research intern at Tencent, and an algorithm engineer at Trip.com Group.

My research interests lie in computer vision and deep learning. Currently, my research particularly focuses on image/video referring segmentation and multi-modal representation learning.
